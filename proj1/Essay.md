# Project Resurrection: Challenges and Triumphs

This essay provides an overview of the process undertaken by Team 59 as we embarked on the journey of reviving five old projects. Initially, we divided our work into four distinct parts, with the first step involving an evaluation of each project based on various criteria, including code coverage, usage of version control tools, task allocation, and automation. During this endeavor, we faced numerous challenges stemming from unclear rubrics and unfamiliar terminologies. Fortunately, most of these issues were successfully resolved through subsequent team meetings. Additionally, gathering evidence to meet the rubric requirements posed difficulties, particularly because team members worked on projects utilizing different programming languages. Despite these initial obstacles, this process greatly contributed to our understanding of the critical components necessary for effective project management. A notable issue we encountered was the lack of discussion under project issues, occasionally making it challenging to grasp certain project aspects.

**Initial Selection**

In the initial stages, our focus was on the "ClassmateBot" project. We addressed various build issues by updating multiple packages, set up a Discord server, and successfully created a bot. However, an unexpected obstacle emerged while setting up Heroku. It was discovered that Heroku, which had been free when the project commenced, had become costly for testing purposes. Consequently, we redirected our attention to other projects, which presented their own set of challenges.

**Final Choice**

Ultimately, we settled on the "Application Tracking System" project due to our ongoing internship applications. This project offered numerous opportunities for improvement, and as we applied to various internships, we identified several areas within the project that could be enhanced. Initially, we encountered an issue with the shutdown script, which consistently crashed due to difficulties in identifying processes related to Flask and Node. This posed the risk of orphan processes and system slowdown. To resolve this issue, we refined the Linux commands in the script to accurately target processes based on their names and terminated them as necessary. Another challenge arose with the backend, which experienced crashes despite the frontend appearing to function correctly. After investigation, we identified that the MongoDB Atlas URI was not correctly configured through variable files, with only the username and password being saved. Once we corrected this configuration, the project started operating as intended. Additionally, we debugged the application search engine used in the project. Originally, the project relied on Google APIs to append parameters and retrieve results directly. However, Google had discontinued this service, now requiring a Google API account with an application key setup. As part of future improvements, we plan to explore potential solutions to address this issue. Throughout these processes, our team maintained constant communication through our chat group. Following the resolution of identified issues, we cloned the code onto all team members' systems, conducting thorough testing to uncover any remaining issues and address edge cases promptly.

**Reflection and Future Measures**

Reflecting on our experiences, we recognize that many of the challenges we faced could have been mitigated through proactive measures. To avoid similar issues in the future, we have identified and committed to implementing the following measures:

- **Thorough Planning**: Our team will adhere to proper software engineering principles to develop efficient and reliable projects that can be easily comprehended and expanded upon by others. This entails dedicating sufficient time to initial planning, ensuring that we possess all necessary information and a deep understanding of the required work. This approach enables us to align project scope, goals, and objectives with stakeholder expectations while proactively managing potential risks or challenges. Key actions include establishing team ground rules, outlining problem descriptions, requirements, constraints, creating detailed design diagrams, and establishing a clear timeline or roadmap.

- **Robust Coding Practices**: Implementing features will involve adhering to sound coding practices to deliver the highest-quality product. Each contributor will individually develop modular code to enhance codebase readability and scalability. Our team will employ both unit and black-box testing to verify functionality, including edge cases, particularly when introducing new features. For effective collaboration, GitHub will serve as our version control and repository hosting platform. We will follow best practices for branching to ensure product stability during development, conducting code reviews to identify and address potential issues, and providing constructive feedback. Badges and GitHub actions will facilitate tasks such as running test cases and monitoring repository quality. Additional collaboration tools integrated into GitHub, including project boards, issue tracking, discussion forums, and insights, will enhance our collaborative efforts.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Throughout the software development process, we will maintain comprehensive documentation, encompassing function comments and detailed documents pertaining to product and code usage. This documentation will encompass clear instructional videos, as demonstrated in other repositories, aimed at supporting future users, whether developers or customers, in effectively utilizing the code. Such documentation streamlines the onboarding process and promotes efficient knowledge transfer, minimizing potential learning curves.

In conclusion, our journey of project resurrection was marked by challenges and solutions, leading to valuable lessons for our team's future endeavors.
