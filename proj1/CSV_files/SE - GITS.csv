"Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)",2,"https://github.com/harshitpatel96/GITS/graphs/contributors, we can see that there is a massive difference between the number of commits and the lines committed by the people. "
Number of commits,3,271 commits in GH
